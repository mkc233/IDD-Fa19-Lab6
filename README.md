# ChatBot

*A lab report by Michael Chan*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I changed the bot to become a Cornell Tech information bot, it talks to the user and asks them what program they are interested in.  It that asks them some more general questions about where they are from and when they plan to apply in order to provide some more information about Cornell Tech.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
